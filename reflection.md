- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
Jessie Wang, Selina Fang, Ella Wang

- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
Sunday 7:00 - 9:00 p.m.

- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
The way we organize our codes (in classes) and the syntax is very different from python. Also, the syntax rules are very strict, which we are forced to write the type for each variable, and this also helps the coding processes greatly.

- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
There are a lot of similarities in programming logic in Python and Java, specifically, how we managed to turn user input into a list and then use for loop to check whether the list contains targeted words. This is where we can turn what we've learned in python into programming with Java. However, there are more differences between Python and Java coding where we need to search online for a lot of times: although the logic is generally the same, the syntax differ greatly. For example, we cannot directly apply how we used to write for loops for python into Java coding. Also, we find it hard to switch from the logic for procedural programming to object-oriented programming. Therefore, in the future, we will put our focus into learning more Java syntax for string methods, list methods, and dictionary methods, for example, and also pay more effort into turning our thinking processes into a object-oriented way.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
We find it comparatively easy to write the attributes and constructors, and also the chat method, which is the large running structure of the chat box. However, we faced a lot of difficuilties when writing the method of respond, specifically, how to mirror the message and replace the word of "you", "I", etc. We first tried to use the string method .contain("abc"), but found out that this method does a lot of misidentification such as replacing the "I" in "Inside". Then, we thought about how we strip strings into list and then use for loop to do the comparison one by one. Then, we get to accurately identify target words without  mistankenly replacing the word, and also avoid repetitive replacing targeted words again and again in for loop.
